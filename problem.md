## The Problem: Waste Contamination in School Cafeterias

In busy school cafeterias, students are often faced with the challenge of correctly sorting their dishes and compostable materials. Unfortunately, improper sorting leads to serious issues such as:
- **Contamination of Recyclables and Compost**: When waste is mixed, recycling processes become inefficient and costly.
- **Higher Operational Costs**: Schools bear increased costs for waste processing and disposal.
- **Environmental Harm**: Contaminated waste undermines sustainability efforts, leading to negative environmental impacts.

Despite awareness campaigns, waste sorting remains a persistent challenge due to time constraints, lack of guidance, and the complexity of the process.

## The Solution: Dish-n-Dash

Dish-n-Dash offers an automated solution to address this critical issue. By combining advanced robotics and intelligent object detection, Dish-n-Dash ensures:
- **Accurate Waste Sorting**: The robot identifies and separates waste into the correct bins.
- **Streamlined Operations**: Automation reduces human error and speeds up the sorting process.
- **Sustainability**: By minimizing contamination, schools can reduce waste, recycle more efficiently, and promote eco-friendly behaviors.

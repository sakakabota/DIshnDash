        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Dish-n-Dash is a robotic system designed to automate waste sorting in school cafeterias. This project aims to reduce waste contamination, lower operational costs, and promote eco-friendly habits among students.</p>

        <h3>Why This Project?</h3>
        <p>In school cafeterias, waste sorting is often done improperly, leading to recycling contamination and inefficiency. Dish-n-Dash addresses this issue using robotics and object detection to ensure accurate sorting and optimized waste management.</p>

        <h3>Real-World Applications</h3>
        <p>The principles and technology behind Dish-n-Dash have broader applications in waste management for public spaces, offices, and other institutions. The system also provides a platform for educational outreach, demonstrating how technology can address environmental challenges.</p>

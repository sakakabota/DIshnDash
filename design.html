        <p>An in-depth look at the design choices and criteria for Dish-n-Dash.</p>

        <h2>Design Criteria</h2>
        <p>The primary design goal was to create a system capable of accurately sorting waste items with minimal human intervention. The following criteria were considered:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>High accuracy in classifying waste categories (e.g., compost, recycling).</li>
            <li>Seamless integration with existing cafeteria setups.</li>
            <li>Durability and robustness to handle real-world use cases.</li>
            <li>Cost-effectiveness for deployment in schools.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Design Overview</h2>
        <p>Our system consists of two main components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Object Detection and Classification:</strong> Using a transformer-based object detection model (DETR with ResNet-50 backbone), the system identifies items such as bowls, fruits, and utensils with high precision.</li>
            <li><strong>Robotic Motion Planning:</strong> A robotic arm with inverse kinematics capabilities executes smooth trajectories to pick and sort items.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Design Choices</h3>
        <p>We made several important design decisions to meet our criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using a depth-sensing camera to enable 3D localization of objects.</li>
            <li>Employing robust materials for the robotic arm to handle varying weights of items.</li>
            <li>Optimizing the software pipeline to reduce latency in object detection and motion execution.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Challenges and Trade-offs</h3>
        <p>While formulating the design, we faced some trade-offs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Balancing cost and accuracy: Advanced components like a depth camera and transformer model increased costs.</li>
            <li>Simplifying grasp strategies: Instead of picking individual items, the robot focuses on handling bowls to minimize errors.</li>
        </ul>

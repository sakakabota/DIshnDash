        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>The Dish-n-Dash project achieved its primary goal of automating waste sorting in school cafeterias. It demonstrated significant potential for real-world applications in waste management and sustainability. Despite the challenges faced during implementation, the results were promising and proved the concept’s feasibility.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Calibrating the robot’s motion to ensure precise and reliable sorting was time-consuming.</li>
            <li>Classification errors occurred with items like bananas in unusual orientations.</li>
            <li>Hardware limitations, such as short cable lengths, led to occasional collisions between the camera and gripper.</li>
            <li>Handling mixed items in bowls required simplification of grasping strategies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Future Revisions</h2>
        <p>Given more time and resources, we propose the following improvements to enhance Dish-n-Dash:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Incorporating advanced grasp generation techniques, such as <strong>Grasp Anything</strong>, to better handle individual items in mixed bowls.</li>
            <li>Expanding the classification model to include more waste categories for better sorting accuracy.</li>
            <li>Implementing retry loops for error handling, ensuring that items are picked up and sorted correctly every time.</li>
            <li>Upgrading hardware components to reduce latency and improve reliability in robotic movements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>The Dish-n-Dash project demonstrated how robotics and computer vision can address real-world challenges in waste management. With further refinement, the system has the potential to make a significant impact in educational and public spaces, promoting sustainability and reducing waste contamination. We look forward to seeing how this concept evolves in the future!</p>
